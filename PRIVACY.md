## What data Hover collects

Hover reads code blocks from webpages you visit (only on sites you explicitly allow). This code is sent to an LLM API to generate documentation.

## Where data is sent

By default, code is sent to OpenRouter (openrouter.ai). If you configure a custom endpoint, code is sent there instead. No data is sent anywhere else.

## What data is stored

Hover stores your settings locally in Chrome:
- API configuration (endpoint URL, API key, model)
- Website permissions (which sites the extension runs on)
- UI preferences (theme)

Code and generated documentation are cached in memory during your session but are not persisted.

## Third parties

Hover does not sell or share data with third parties. The only external service is the LLM API provider you configure (OpenRouter or your custom endpoint).

## Your control

- You choose which sites Hover runs on via Chrome permissions
- You can use a custom endpoint to keep data within your own infrastructure
- You can disable or uninstall the extension at any time
